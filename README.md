# The Hoppertron Inc Team proudly presents our Hackathon Project "Frogs of Fury"

Welcome to Frogs of Fury, a retro-inspired action game that pays homage to the classic "Contra" while offering a fresh, vertical challenge. In this game, players must navigate their way through an endless vertical landscape by leaping from platform to platform, all while avoiding or defeating various enemies. The higher you go, the more perilous the journey becomes. But beware: the map dissolves beneath you, so any missed jump or hesitation could lead to your demise. Whether playing solo or with a friend in co-op mode, your goal is to ascend as high as possible and survive the relentless challenges thrown your way.

- **Primary Colors:** The overall background uses a deep, almost black shade (#00000b), creating a stark contrast with bright elements.
- **Accent Colors:** Vivid green (#00ff00) is used for borders and highlights, adding a neon-like glow emphasizing interactive elements.
- **Text and Backgrounds:** White (#ffffff) and slightly off-white tones are used for text and background panels to ensure clarity against the dark background, with subtle shadow effects adding depth.

### Characters

The characters in "Frog of Fury" are designed with distinct color palettes that emphasize their roles and enhance the visual contrast against the game’s environments.

- **Player 1:** The character sprites use dark tones (#02060A) with vibrant highlights, ensuring visibility against diverse backgrounds.
- **Player 2 Variant:** This sprite has a unique color scheme dominated by dark purples (#390062), differentiating it from the primary character.
- **Mosquito:** The mosquito sprites feature sharp contrasts with black (#000000) and light cyan tones (#E3F7EB) to stand out as enemies.
- **Snake:** The snake sprite combines deep blacks (#000000) with electric blues (#0A50FF), giving it a cold, mechanical feel.

### Gameplay Map

The color scheme for "Frog of Fury" draws heavily from natural and earthy tones, combined with bright, contrasting colors that enhance the retro gaming feel.

- **Lava Tile:** Vivid oranges and reds (e.g., #EF6C00, #FFA726) dominate this tile, capturing the intense heat and danger associated with lava. These colors contrast sharply with the other more muted tones.
- **Platform Tile:** Shades of green (e.g., #4CAF50, #22B14C) are used, evoking the lushness of nature. This green palette is critical for representing the platforms and safe zones the player interacts with.
- **Wall Tile:** Muted browns and dark grays (e.g., #4A312B, #6B473D) provide a solid, sturdy appearance, reinforcing the feeling of immovable obstacles in the game.

# Features

Welcome to "Frogs of Fury," where retro gaming meets relentless action. In this section, you'll discover everything that makes our game an exhilarating experience. From navigating the home screen to mastering the game mechanics, controlling your frog hero, and getting to know the team behind the game, we've got you covered. Dive in to explore the core features that bring "Frogs of Fury" to life and prepare yourself for an unforgettable adventure!

## Gameplay

"Frogs of Fury" is a thrilling retro game that brings back the intense action of classics like "Contra" with a unique twist. In this game, one or two players take control of fearless frogs, navigating an endless vertical map. The goal? To jump as high as possible while battling enemies and avoiding the rising danger from below.

- **Vertical Progression:** The game features an endless vertical map where players must leap from platform to platform, climbing ever higher. But beware, the map is slowly disintegrating from the bottom up, with deadly lava steadily rising. If you fall or take too long, the lava will catch up, so speed is of the essence.

- **Enemy Encounters:** As you ascend, you’ll face off against various enemies like snakes and mosquitoes. These foes become more challenging the higher you go, keeping you on your toes and adding to the game’s increasing difficulty.

- **Weapons and Power-Ups:** You start with a basic weapon, but by defeating enemies, you can unlock special weapons. Some enemies drop gadgets when defeated, which you can collect to upgrade your arsenal. Not every enemy will drop these power-ups, so you’ll need to strategize and make every shot count.

- **Rising Challenge:** The higher you climb, the tougher the game becomes. Platforms get smaller, enemies get stronger, and the lava rises faster. Quick reflexes and precise jumps are crucial if you want to survive and continue your ascent.

- **Co-op Mode:** In the 2-player mode, you can team up with a friend to face the challenges together. Cooperation is key, as you’ll need to support each other to overcome the increasingly difficult obstacles.

"Frogs of Fury" is all about testing your skills in a race against time and the ever-looming threat from below. Only the most agile and daring frogs will reach the top and earn their place in the "Frogs of Fury" hall of fame!
