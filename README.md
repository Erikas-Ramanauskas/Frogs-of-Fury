# The Hoppertron Inc Team proudly presents our Hackathon Project "Frogs of Fury"

Welcome to Frogs of Fury, a retro-inspired action game that pays homage to the classic "Contra" while offering a fresh, vertical challenge. In this game, players must navigate their way through an endless vertical landscape by leaping from platform to platform, all while avoiding or defeating various enemies. The higher you go, the more perilous the journey becomes. But beware: the map dissolves beneath you, so any missed jump or hesitation could lead to your demise. Whether playing solo or with a friend in co-op mode, your goal is to ascend as high as possible and survive the relentless challenges thrown your way.

# Features

## Gameplay

"Frogs of Fury" is a thrilling retro game that brings back the intense action of classics like "Contra" with a unique twist. In this game, one or two players take control of fearless frogs, navigating an endless vertical map. The goal? To jump as high as possible while battling enemies and avoiding the rising danger from below.

- **Vertical Progression:** The game features an endless vertical map where players must leap from platform to platform, climbing ever higher. But beware, the map is slowly disintegrating from the bottom up, with deadly lava steadily rising. If you fall or take too long, the lava will catch up, so speed is of the essence.

- **Enemy Encounters:** As you ascend, you’ll face off against various enemies like snakes and mosquitoes. These foes become more challenging the higher you go, keeping you on your toes and adding to the game’s increasing difficulty.

- **Weapons and Power-Ups:** You start with a basic weapon, but by defeating enemies, you can unlock special weapons. Some enemies drop gadgets when defeated, which you can collect to upgrade your arsenal. Not every enemy will drop these power-ups, so you’ll need to strategize and make every shot count.

- **Rising Challenge:** The higher you climb, the tougher the game becomes. Platforms get smaller, enemies get stronger, and the lava rises faster. Quick reflexes and precise jumps are crucial if you want to survive and continue your ascent.

- **Co-op Mode:** In the 2-player mode, you can team up with a friend to face the challenges together. Cooperation is key, as you’ll need to support each other to overcome the increasingly difficult obstacles.

"Frogs of Fury" is all about testing your skills in a race against time and the ever-looming threat from below. Only the most agile and daring frogs will reach the top and earn their place in the "Frogs of Fury" hall of fame!
